# PyFLP

PyFLP allows an object oriented access to an FLP. This provides an abstraction from its TLV implementation. _Please don't use this for serious stuffs yet._

You should also check these:

- [**FLPInfo**](https://github.com/demberto/FLPInfo) to see basic information about an FLP.
- [**FLPInspect**](https://github.com/demberto/FLPInspect) for a further, detailed view into the internal structure of an FLP.

## Thanks

[**Monad.FLParser**](https://github.com/monadgroup/FLParser) for providing up-to-date parsing logic and the idea of creating an object model

**FLPEdit** [(author)](https://github.com/roadcrewworker) I swear, this library would have remained a dream without this tool. A very helpful program for examining the event structure as it is present in an FLP and value of events. It is very unfortunate that the author has removed it.

## Contributions

If you can spare some time for testing and/or contributing, I would be very grateful. Please check the [TODO](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/blob/master/TODO.md) as well for current goals/issues. Its kind of getting difficult for me as this project becomes bigger. You can reach me at **demberto**[at]**protonmail**[dot]**com** as well :)
