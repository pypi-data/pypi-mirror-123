HDLG is a modern cross-platform GUI for hdl-dump with Batch installation capabilities.

## Looking for Artwork

This project is looking for an Icon and Text Logo as well as a Banner artwork. If you have some free time and would
like to contribute artwork to the project, let me know!

## Installation

    pip install --user hdlg

To run hdlg, type `hdlg` into any terminal, command prompt, app launcher, or the start menu.

If you wish to manually install from the source, take a look at [Building](#building-source-and-wheel-distributions).

## To-do

- [ ] Craft initial GUI with Qt.
- [ ] Create a file based settings system.
- [ ] Add local PS2 HDD connection option.
- [ ] Add remote PS2 HDD (samba) connection option.
- [ ] List installed games of selected HDD.
- [ ] Add button to install a new game to selected HDD.
- [ ] Add PyInstaller support (PyInstaller spec file).
- [ ] Add information about a PS2 HDD like size, space used, games installed, count games by game type (PS2 DVD/CD, PS1), etc.
- [ ] Push to PyPI and add relevant Badges.

## Working with the Source Code

This project requires [Poetry], so feel free to take advantage and use it for its various conveniences like
building sdist/wheel packages, creating and managing dependencies, virtual environments, and more.

Note:

- Source Code may have changes that may be old, not yet tested or stable, or may have regressions.
- Only run or install from Source Code if you have a good reason. Examples would be to test for regressions, test
  changes (either your own or other contributors), or to research the code (agreeing to the [LICENSE](LICENSE)).
- [Poetry] is required as it's used as the [PEP 517] build system, virtual environment manager, dependency manager,
  and more.

  [Poetry]: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>
  [PEP 517]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517>

### Install from Source Code

    git clone https://github.com/rlaphoenix/hdlg.git
    cd hdlg
    pip install --user .

### Building source and wheel distributions

    poetry build

You can specify `-f` to build `sdist` or `wheel` only. Built files can be found in the `/dist` directory.

### Packing with PyInstaller

    python -m pip install --user pyinstaller
    poetry run pyinstaller hdlg.spec
    .\dist\hdlg.exe

Feel free to apply any CLI options/switches you feel like, see `pyinstaller -h`.
