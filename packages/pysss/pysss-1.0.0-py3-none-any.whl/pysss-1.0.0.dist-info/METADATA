This is a minimalist and yet complete implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing
Algorithm as described in [^JACM1979].
The goal is to provide, as much as possible, a generic and efficient
implementation.
There are two ports of the algorithm in two languages: C and Python.
Each port can be used separately from the other.
