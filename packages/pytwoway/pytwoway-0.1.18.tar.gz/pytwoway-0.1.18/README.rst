`PyTwoWay` is the Python package associated with the following paper:

"`How Much Should we Trust Estimates of Firm Effects and Worker Sorting? <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27368/w27368.pdf>`_" 
by St√©phane Bonhomme, Kerstin Holzheu, Thibaut Lamadon, Elena Manresa, Magne Mogstad, and Bradley Setzler.  
No. w27368. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020.

The package provides implementations for a series of estimators for models with two sided heterogeneity:

1. two way fixed effect estimator as proposed by Abowd Kramarz and Margolis
2. homoskedastic bias correction as in Andrews et al
3. heteroskedastic correction as in KSS
4. a group fixed estimator as in BLM
5. a group correlated random effect as presented in the main paper

If you want to give it a try, you can start the example notebook here: |binder|. This starts a fully interactive notebook with a simple example that generates data and runs the estimators.

The code is relatively efficient. Solving large sparse linear models relies on `PyAMG <https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg>`_. This is the code we use to estimate the different decompositions on US data. 

The package provides a Python interface as well as an intuitive command line interface. Installation is handled by `pip` or `Conda` (TBD). The source of the package is available on GitHub at `PyTwoWay <https://github.com/tlamadon/pytwoway>`_. The online documentation is hosted  `here <https://tlamadon.github.io/pytwoway/>`_.

Quick Start
-----------

To install via pip, from the command line run::

    pip install pytwoway


To run PyTwoWay via the command line interface, from the command line run::

    pytw --my-config config.txt --fe --cre


Example config.txt::

    data = file.csv
    filetype = csv
    col_dict = "{'i': 'your_workerid_col', 'j': 'your_firmid_col', 'y': 'your_compensation_col', 't': 'your_year_col'}"
