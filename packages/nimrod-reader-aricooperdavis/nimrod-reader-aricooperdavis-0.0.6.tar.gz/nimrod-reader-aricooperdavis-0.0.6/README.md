# NIMROD_Reader
A python 3.x script to read Met Office composite radar scenes in the NIMROD format.

This should be able to read all three types of composite scene (UK @ 1km, UK @ 5km and Europe @ 5km) but the geotiff creation part of the library has only been tested with UK @ 1km data.

If you are a CEDA user then you can find NIMROD data data in: /badc/ukmo-nimrod/

Requires: Numpy, gdal
