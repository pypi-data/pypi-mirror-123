# django filter groups

This package groups filters generated by django-filter
The main reason to use it - don't show all filters (show only selected filters)

## how to use
```
pip install django-filter-grouped
```
add to your `INSTALLED_APPS` after `django-filter`

use it in your template `{% filters_by_groups %}`

if FilterSet name is not 'filter' -> add filterset name
`{% filters_by_groups my_custom_filterset %}`
