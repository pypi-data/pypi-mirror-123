# PyApacheAtlas: API Support for Azure Purview and Apache Atlas

A python package to work with the Azure Purview and Apache Atlas API. Supporting bulk loading, custom lineage, and more from a Pythonic set of classes and Excel templates.

The package supports programmatic interaction and an Excel template for low-code uploads.

The Excel template provides a means to:
* Bulk upload entities
  * Supports adding glossary terms to entities.
  * Supports adding classifications to entities.
  * Supports creating relationships between entities (e.g. columns of a table).
* Creating custom lineage between two existing entities.
* Bulk upload of type definitions.
* Bulk upload of classification definitions (Purview Classification rules are not currently supported).
* Creating custom table and complex column level lineage in the [Hive Bridge style](https://atlas.apache.org/0.8.3/Bridge-Hive.html).
  * Supports Azure Purview ColumnMapping Attributes.

The PyApacheAtlas package itself supports those operations and more for the advanced user:
* Programmatically create Entities, Types (Entity, Relationship, etc.).
* Perform partial updates of an entity (for non-complex attributes like strings or integers).
* Extracting entities by guid or qualified name.
* Creating custom lineage with Process and Entity types.
* Working with the glossary.
  * Uploading terms.
  * Downloading individual or all terms.
* Working with classifications.
  * Classify one entity with multiple classifications.
  * Classify multiple entities with a single classification.
  * Remove classification ("declassify") from an entity.
* Working with relationships.
  * Able to create arbitrary relationships between entities.
  * e.g. associating a given column with a table.
* Deleting types (by name) or entities (by guid).
* Creating a column lineage scaffolding as in the Hive Bridge Style .
* Performing "What-If" analysis to check if...
   * Your entities are valid types.
   * Your entities are missing required attributes.
   * Your entities are using undefined attributes.
* Search (only for Azure Purview advanced search).
* Authentication to Azure Purview via Service Principal.
* Authentication using basic authentication of username and password for open source Atlas.
