# PlesicDB

PlesicDB stores data in **JSON** format.

Plesic uses folders as database.

You need to specify a directory to store all databases in that directory. In that folder there are chunks of collections.

Every database collection-chunk size is default to (2*CPU_CORES)

Usage
======

Simple program
--------------

Below is an example of how to import plesicdb and creating database and collection.

```
>>> from plesicdb import Plesic

>>> pl = Plesic("/home/mydbs")   # directory to store all databases in it.

>>> db = pl["myapp"]             # Getting database
>>> db.chunksize = 16            # This will work

>>> users = db["users"]          # Users collection
>>> db.chunksize = 16            # This won't work
```

If you want to change `chunksize` you need to set it before you get the collection.
