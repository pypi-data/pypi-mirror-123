### üíº Example Use Cases

* Creating a foundation for an API wrapper
* Recreating a request outside the browser
* Testing what cookies or headers are required for a server to understand your request

### ‚úÇÔ∏è How to Copy

1.  Inspect Element
2.  Go to `Network` tab
3.  Find web request
4.  Right-Click
5.  Copy
6.  Choose one of the following:
     1. Powershell 
     2. Node.JS fetch

## üì¶ Installation

install the package with pip

```
$ pip install autorequests
```

or download the latest development build from GitHub

```
$ pip install -U git+https://github.com/Hexiro/autorequests
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Command Line

```console
$ autorequests --help
```

directory options

```console
  -i, --input           Input Directory
  -o, --output          Output Directory
```

generation options

```
  --return-text         Makes the generated method's responses return .text instead of .json()
  --no-headers          Removes all headers from the operation
  --no-cookies          Removes all cookies from the operation
  --parameters          Replaces hardcoded params, json, data, etc with parameters that have default values
```

## üö© Known Issues

* Method names are parsed from the url, but if the URL doesn't have any paths with a valid method name, an invalid
  method name will be used.
* Sometimes when copying from the browser, important headers aren't included which causes the resulting API
  wrapper to fail requests.
* Parsing multipart/form-data when copying with the powershell mode isn't supported

## üìÖ # TODO
* unit tests w/ pytest
* clean up cli
* replace ***--compare*** with ***--diff*** which shows diffs in console
* better output w/ rich
* possibly decouple method & class ?
