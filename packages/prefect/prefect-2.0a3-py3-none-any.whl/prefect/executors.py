"""
Interface and implementations of various task run executors.

**Executors** in Prefect are responsible for managing the execution of Prefect task runs. Generally speaking, users are not expected to interact with executors outside of configuring and initializing them for a flow.

Example:

    >>> from prefect import flow, task, executors
    >>> from typing import List
    >>>
    >>> @task
    >>> def say_hello(name):
    ...     print(f"hello {name}")
    >>>
    >>> @task
    >>> def say_goodbye(name):
    ...     print(f"goodbye {name}")
    >>>
    >>> @flow(executor=executors.SequentialExecutor())
    >>> def greetings(names: List[str]):
    ...     for name in names:
    ...         say_hello(name)
    ...         say_goodbye(name)
    >>>
    >>> greetings(["arthur", "trillian", "ford", "marvin"])
    hello arthur
    goodbye arthur
    hello trillian
    goodbye trillian
    hello ford
    goodbye ford
    hello marvin
    goodbye marvin

    Switching to a `DaskExecutor`:
    >>> flow.executor = executors.DaskExecutor()
    >>> greetings(["arthur", "trillian", "ford", "marvin"])
    hello arthur
    goodbye arthur
    hello trillian
    hello ford
    goodbye marvin
    hello marvin
    goodbye ford
    goodbye trillian

The following executors are currently supported:

- `SequentialExecutor`: the simplest executor and the default; submits each task run sequentially as they are called and blocks until completion
- `DaskExecutor`: creates a `LocalCluster` that task runs are submitted to; allows for parallelism with a flow run

!!! warning "The DaskExecutor uses multiprocessing"
    Please note that because the `DaskExecutor` uses multiprocessing, it must only be used interactively or protected by an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.
