        # Setting Up a Driver
        
        [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) is recommended as it has more options, but Firefox and IE drivers are compatible as well. Set the path to your chosen driver as a system environment variable named CHROME_DRIVER FIREFOX_DRIVER, or IE_DRIVER.
