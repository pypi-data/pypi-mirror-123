## What's new?

- Removed commons.py module (Use make_pack_list function from packmakers.py module).
- Information updated. 

In the near future, most likely to the next version
you can refuse to parse * .json files, since files with commands like * .cfg
much easier and more convenient to use. If anyone has a different opinion on this matter, write.

## Description:

A package of modules for working with commands, 
command packages, files containing command packages.
 
Used to create utilities for working with commands (execution, launch, autorun, storage).

You can keep your commands in simple and understandable files, collect them in one place,
split into named categories (packages) and execute at any time:

The files must have the extension *.cfg, or *.json and have the correct structure:


### commands.cfg:

```text
[package name 1]
command 1
command 2
command N

[package name 2]
command 1
command 2
command N
```

### commands.json:

```json5
{
  "pack name":

  [
    "command1",
    "command2",
    "commandN"
  ],

  "pack name2":

  [
    "command1",
    "command2",
    "commandN"
  ]
}
```
