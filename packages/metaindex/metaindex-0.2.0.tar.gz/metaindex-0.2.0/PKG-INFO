# metaindex

metaindex allows you to find files based on metadata information.

For example, if you want to find all pictures that are have a certain width,
you could do this:

    metaindex find mimetype:image resolution:1200x


## Installation

To install metaindex either install it directly through pypi:

    pip install metaindex

Or clone the repository and install that then through pip:

    git clone https://github.com/vonshednob/metaindex
    cd metaindex
    pip install .

Most modules are optional. If you, for example, want to use metaindex for audio
files and PDFs, you will have to install it like this:

    pip install metaindex[pdf,audio]

or, for the cloned repository:

    pip install .[pdf,audio]

These modules exist for indexing:

 - `pdf`, for PDF files,
 - `audio`, any type of audio/music file,
 - `image`, any type of image file,
 - `video`, any type of video file (overlaps somewhat with `audio`),
 - `ebook`, ebooks and comic book formats,
 - `xdg`, support for XDG (if you use Linux, just add it),
 - `yaml`, extra metadata in YAML format,
 - `ocr`, find and extract text from images with tesseract (you must have
   tesseract installed for this to work).

In case you just want everything, this is your install command:

    pip install .[all]

There is also an experimental FuseFS filesystem. To be able to use it, you
will have to specify ``fuse`` as an additional module:

    pip install .[all,fuse]


## Usage

Before you can use metaindex to search for files, you have to initialize the
cache by telling it where your files to index are, for example:

    metaindex index --recursive --index ~/Pictures

Afterwards you can start searching for files by metadata, like this:

    metaindex find 


## Searching

Search queries for use with `metaindex find` allow you to search

 - for files that have a metadata tag: `metaindex find resolution?`
 - for files that have a metadata tag with a certain value: `metaindex find title:"dude, where is my car"`
 - for files that have any metadata tag with a certain value: `metaindex find "just anything"`

Each value that you provide is actually a case insensitive regular expression.
