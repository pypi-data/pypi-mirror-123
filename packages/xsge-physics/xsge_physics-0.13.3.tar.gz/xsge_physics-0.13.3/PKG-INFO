Description: xSGE is a collection of higher-level extensions for the SGE which
        enhance the core functionality in an implementation-independent way.
        Like the SGE itself, they are distribted under the terms of the GNU
        Lesser General Public License.
        
        This extension provides an easy-to-use framework for collision physics.
        This is especially useful for platformers, though it can also be useful
        for other types of games.
