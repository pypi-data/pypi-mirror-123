## Typing stubs for retry

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `retry` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `retry`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/retry. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `994b69ef8f18e76689daca3947879c3d7f76173e`.
