### Installation
It's recommended to stream episodes using a video player (no ads)
Currently only mpv is supported.

You can install anime-cli from pip using
```
pip install anime-cli
```
Then run using `python -m anime_cli` or simply `anime-cli`

If you want to help develop `anime-cli`. It is recommended that you clone the repo using and then install the dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/chirag-droid/anime-cli.git
poetry install
```
and then to run, `poetry run anime-cli`

### Motivation

I recently found out about [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli), but it was not cross-platform because it was written in shell, so I decided to recreate that same thing in Python, hoping to make it cross-platform and possibly also have pretty UI.

### TODO
