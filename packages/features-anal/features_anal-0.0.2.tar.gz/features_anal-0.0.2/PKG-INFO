# Feature Analysis: Simple Feature Analysis in Python

It performs feature analysis for data preprocessing or usage of data in Machine Learning.
# Methods

There are four methods used to identify features to remove:

1. Finding Missing Values (find_missing(missing_threshold)) 

   %% Find the features with a fraction of missing values above `missing_threshold`
2. Single Unique Values (find_unique())

    %% Find the features having a single unique value. NaNs do not count as a unique value.
3. Collinear Features (find_collinear(correlation_threshold,one_hot=False))

   %% Finds collinear features based on the `correlation coefficient` between features.
4. Low Importance Features (find_low_impt(cumulative_impt,label))

   %% Finds the lowest importance features not needed to account for `cumulative_importance` fraction
        of the total feature importance from the gradient boosting machine.
        label corresponding to regession or classification

## Usage

Refer to the [testing.py](https://github.com/coolestbnslz/Feature_Analysis/blob/main/testing.py) for how to use the different methods in module.

## Visualizations

The `FeatureAnalysis` methods also includes a number of visualization in each methods mentioned above to inspect 
characteristics of a dataset.
