Description: # clista - CLI to STreamlit App
        Create interactive web app from any CLI with streamlit
        
        ## Status
        Very early alpha version, tested only with `hey`.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install clista
        ```
        
        ## Why
        There are different ways to do task "benchmark a website"
        
        - Type the command to run it then copy the output and write to the report.
        - Write a script to run the command 10 times then copy the output and write to the report.
        - Learn Jupyter and run the command from there, export the notebook as Playbook and use as report.
        - Write a webapp to run the command and display the result (take 2 months, and 5 people).
        - Write a streamlit app and let who give the task run themselves, as they need.
        
        ## Use-cases
        - Build one-time-used internal tool
        - Build internal tool
        - Build amazing tool (TODO later on this)
        
        ## Usage
        ### Example with hey
        [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) is a CLI HTTP load generator, like
        `apache bench`.
        
        ```sh
        $ hey 2>&1 | clista
        Wrote stapp.py, please copy and edit as needed then run streamlit run stapp.py
        NOTE: rerun would overwrite stapp.py
        
        $ streamlit run stapp.py
        
          You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

        Open `stapp.py`, removes undesired options and run to bench itself:
