Description: Note:
        
           VERSION needs to be formatted following the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention
           (we need to follow this convention to be able to retrieve versioned scripts)
        
        Simple check list for release from AllenNLP repo: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/setup.py
        
        To create the package for pypi.
        
        0. Prerequisites:
           - Dependencies:
             - twine: "pip install twine"
           - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):
             - PyPI: https://pypi.org/
             - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/
        
        1. Change the version in:
           - __init__.py
           - setup.py
           - docs/source/conf.py
        
        2. Commit these changes: "git commit -m 'Release: VERSION'"
        
        3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag VERSION -m 'Add tag VERSION for pypi'"
           Push the tag to remote: git push --tags origin master
        
        4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between
           creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).
        
           First, delete any "build" directory that may exist from previous builds.
        
           For the wheel, run: "python setup.py bdist_wheel" in the top level directory.
           (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).
        
           For the sources, run: "python setup.py sdist"
           You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.
        
        5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:
        
           twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
        
           Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:
           pip install huggingface_hub fsspec aiohttp
           pip install -U tqdm
           pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets
        
        6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
           twine upload dist/* -r pypi
        
        7. Fill release notes in the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
        
        8. Update the documentation commit in .circleci/deploy.sh for the accurate documentation to be displayed.
           Update the version mapping in docs/source/_static/js/custom.js with: "python utils/release.py --version VERSION"
           Set version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. 1.8.0 -> 1.8.1.dev0) in:
           - setup.py
           - __init__.py
        
        9. Commit these changes: "git commit -m 'Release docs'"
           Push the commit to remote: "git push origin master"
