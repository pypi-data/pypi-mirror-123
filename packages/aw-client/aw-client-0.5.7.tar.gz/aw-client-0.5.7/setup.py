If you want to install it\nsystem-wide it can be installed with `pip install .`, but that has the issue\nthat it might not get the exact version of the dependencies due to not reading\nthe poetry.lock file.\n\n## Debugging\n\n* Run python with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to get additional debugging output\n* If invalid events have been queued for submission, you may need to delete the file-based queues generated by this library\n* To use the development version of this library use `aw-client = {path = "../aw-client" }` in `pyproject.toml`\n\n## Examples\n\nThe `examples/` directory contains a couple of example scripts, including:\n\n - `time_spent_today.py` - fetches all non-afk events and sums their duration to get the total active time for the day.\n - `merge_buckets.py` - merges two buckets with non-intersecting events by moving all events from one into the other.\n - `redact_sensitive.py` - redact sensitive events.\n',
