Installation
============

GRC follows standard Python packaging guidelines and can be installed using::

   pip install grc


If you do not have administrative permissions on your system you can install it
as user::

Or, in any case install it into an isolated environment::

   python3 -m venv /path/to/your/installation
   /path/to/your/installation/bin/pip install grc
