WARNING - Pending Project Rename
================================

In order to make roon on pypi for the original ``grc`` project, this project
will be renamed to ``strec`` soon. The new name was chosen to be very different
from ``grc`` to show that it's a different project. While both *do* the same,
they do it in a very different manner, and more importantly, the config format
is different.

See https://grc.readthedocs.io/en/latest (or docs/README.rst)
