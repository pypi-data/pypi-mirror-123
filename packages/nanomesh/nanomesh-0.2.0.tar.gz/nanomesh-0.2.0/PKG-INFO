# nanomesh

Creates 3d meshes from microscopy experimental data.

Documentation: https://nanomesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Installation

If you use conda, create a new environment:

```
conda create -n nanomesh python=3.8
conda activate nanomesh
```

Install nanomesh:

```
git clone https://github.com/hpgem/nanomesh.git
cd nanomesh
pip install .
```

Note, [to enable the IPython widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html#installation):

```
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

Note, [if you are using Jupyter lab](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets#installation):

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-matplotlib jupyterlab-datawidgets itkwidgets
```

### With pygalmesh (linux only)

To use some of the additional functionality depending on pygalmesh,
first install the dependencies for pygalmesh (CGAL and EIGEN3)

```
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev libeigen3-dev
```

The instructions are the same as above, except specify `with_pygalmesh` as option
to trigger the installation of pygalmesh. Currently this installs
[our fork](https://github.com/hpgem/pygalmesh).

```
pip install .[with_pygalmesh]
```

### Development

Install `nanomesh` using the development dependencies:

`pip install -e .[develop] -c constraints.txt`

Running the tests:

`pytest`

Linting/checks:

`pre-commit`

Building the docs:

```
make html --directory docs
```
