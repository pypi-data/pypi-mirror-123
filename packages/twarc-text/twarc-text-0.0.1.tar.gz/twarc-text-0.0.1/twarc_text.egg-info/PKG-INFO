Description: # twarc-text
        
        This module extends [twarc] to allow you to print out tweets as text for easy
        testing on the command line. Maybe it's useful for spot checking files you've
        collected, or your search queries. It's really just a gimmick :) Send a PR to
        make it better!

        ## Install
        
            pip install twarc-text
        
        ## Use
        
        If you've got a file of tweets that you've previously collected you can print
        them out:
        
            twarc2 text tweets.jsonl
        
        Also you can pipe directly, for example displaying the sample stream:
        
            twarc2 sample | twarc2 text
