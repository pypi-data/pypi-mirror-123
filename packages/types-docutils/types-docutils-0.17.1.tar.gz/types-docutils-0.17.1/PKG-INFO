## Typing stubs for docutils

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `docutils` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `docutils`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/docutils. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9f869723509ac027bae6b6f567b921d6a229e8ec`.
