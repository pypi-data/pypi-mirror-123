Description: # Borgo
        
        Borgo is an [API](https://pypi.org/project/borgo) + [App](https://borgo.app) for easily interfacing with your python scripts.
        
        If your script needs human input, create a borgo request, and it will be sent to your mobile app. Your script will wait until you act on the request, and then continue with the results.
        
        For example:
        
        ```python
        from borgo import *
        
        borgo_key = '''
        eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIOTYwYjA1Yzk3ZmE0MDljNDdhNDQ0ZTciLCZXRva2VuLmdvb2dsZSyZ28...
        '''
        
        with BorgoClient(borgo_key) as borgo_client:
          request = BorgoRequest('Should I tweet "hello world"?', 'Tweet', "Don't tweet")
          response = borgo_client.wait_for(request)
        
          if (response.is_accepted):
            # Send "hello world" to Twitter API.
        ```
        
        ## Getting a Key
        
        To get a key to pass into the `BorgoClient(...)` constructor, sign in to [borgo.app](https://borgo.app), click on the "key" icon, hit the button to copy the key to your clipboard and then paste it as a string into your script.
