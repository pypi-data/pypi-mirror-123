# Borgo

Borgo is an API + App for easily interfacing with your python scripts.

If your script needs human input, create a borgo request, and it will be sent to your mobile app. Your script will wait until you act on the request, and then continue with the results.

For example:

```python
from borgo import *

borgo_key = '''
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIOTYwYjA1Yzk3ZmE0MDljNDdhNDQ0ZTciLCZXRva2VuLmdvb2dsZSyZ28...
'''

with BorgoClient(borgo_key) as borgo_client:
  request = BorgoRequest('Should I tweet "hello world"?', 'Tweet', "Don't tweet")
  response = borgo_client.wait_for(request)

  if (response.is_accepted):
    # Send "hello world" to Twitter API.
```

## Getting a Key

To get a key to pass into the `BorgoClient(...)` constructor, sign in to [borgo.app](https://borgo.app), click on the "key" icon, hit the button to copy the key to your clipboard and then paste it as a string into your script.
