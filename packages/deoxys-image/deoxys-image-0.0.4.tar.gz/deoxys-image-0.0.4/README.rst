* Documentation: https://deoxys-image.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

Apply different image-processing functions to images:

* Affine Transformation: rotation, translation, scaling, flipping
* Point operation: increase/decrease brightness and contrast, add Gaussian noise
* Filter operation: Gaussian blur

Increase speed with multiprocessing by setting the following environment variables:

* On Windows: `set NUM_CPUS=4`
* On Linux: `export NUM_CPUS=4`

If the runtime environment does not have write-access to `/tmp/ray`, change the `RAY_ROOT` environment variable to another accessible path.
