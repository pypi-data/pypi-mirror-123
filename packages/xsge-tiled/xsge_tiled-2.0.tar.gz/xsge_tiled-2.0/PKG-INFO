Description: xSGE is a collection of higher-level extensions for the SGE which
        enhance the core functionality in an implementation-independent way.
        Like the SGE itself, they are distribted under the terms of the GNU
        Lesser General Public License.
        
        This extension provides support for loading the JSON format of the
        `Tiled Map Editor <http://www.mapeditor.org/>`_.  This allows you to use
        Tiled to edit your game's world (e.g. levels), rather than building a
        level editor yourself.
