## Typing stubs for itsdangerous

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `itsdangerous` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `itsdangerous`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/itsdangerous. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `itsdangerous` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.0. Please uninstall the `types-itsdangerous`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `994b69ef8f18e76689daca3947879c3d7f76173e`.
