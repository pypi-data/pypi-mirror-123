# C0111     missing-docstring       Our priority is to make the code document
#                                   itself. Docstring is required only when
#                                   the signature is not enough to tell

# W0611     unused-import           Pylint does not count our type-hinting
#                                   annotations as a use of a class name, thus,
#                                   this rule results in many false-positives.
#                                   nnX has its own implementation for this

# R0201     no-self-use             Extracting private methods inside a class
#                                   to increase readability often results in
#                                   some methods that don't use the `self`.
#
# W0613     unused-argument         Methods of test doubles, for example stubs,
#                                   often return canned values, not using any

#                                   class (Python 3 does not have old-style classes)

# I0011     locally-disabled        Disabling a Pylint warning is always the
#                                   result of a decision, no additional notification
#                                   is required to tell us what we did.

# R0921     abstract-class-not-used We are writing a library, so there may be unimplemented
#                                   abstract classes that may be used by third-party
#                                   applications (i.e. another product).
#
# R0922     abstract-class-little-used
#                                   This is the same error for all intents and purposes as
#                                   R0921.
#
# E1103     maybe-no-member         This message is useless since it produces too many false
#                                   positives (i.e. it thinks Resolver.resolve consistently
#                                   returns a Path instance).
#
# C1001     old-style-class         This message is irrelevant since Python 3.2 has no old-style
#                                   classes anymore.
#
# W0232     no-init                 New-style classes (see above) do not require __init__ methods,
#                                   the object class has a perfectly fine default constructor.
#
# C0325     superfluous-parents     Writing `not (a == b)` is equivalent with `not a == b`,
#                                   however, adding the parenthesis can often improve readability.
#
# C0326     bad-whitespace          Too many false positives, often misses tabularly indented
#                                   data in unit tests.
#
# C0330     bad-continuation        Too many false positives.
#
# W0231     super-init-not-called   We often write test doubles (stubs, fakes, etc.) for production
#                                   collaborators of various classes so we can unit test them. Most
#                                   of such test-doubles don't call super's __init__(), requiring a
#                                   lot of noise disabling this warning for all of them. Also, if a
#                                   production class does not call its super's __init__() and it
#                                   triggers a bug, then it should be caught by a test instead.
#
# R0801     duplicate-code          Most of the issues reported as duplicate code are in fact import
#                                   sections of highly similar plugins (i.e. presenters that definitely
#                                   will have the same import section in a lot of cases). Because of
#                                   this many false positives were reported.
