  Notice of Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros
subquestion: |
  A Notice of Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros can be filed in the event the Plaintiff has not filed its complaint.  Please review the rule of Pennsylvania of Civil Procedure before completing this document.
  
  **Please review the rule of Pennsylvania of Civil Procedure before completing this document.**
  
  ### Rule 237.1. Notice of Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros for Failure to File Complaint or by Default for Failure to Plead
  
  (a)(1) As used in this rule, “judgment of non pros” means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to Rule 1037(a) and 1659;
  
  * Note: When a defendant appeals from a judgment entered in a magisterial district [judge] court, Pa. R.C.P.M.D.J. 1004(b) authorizes the appellant to file a praecipe for a rule as of course upon the appellee to file a complaint or suffer entry of a judgment of non pros. The entry of the judgment of non pros is governed by Pa. R.C.P. No. 1037(a) and is subject to this rule. “judgment by default” means a judgment entered by praecipe pursuant to Rules 1037(b), 1511(a), 3031(a), and 3146(a).
  
  (2) No judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default for failure to plead shall be entered by the prothonotary unless the praecipe for entry includes a certification that a written notice of intention to file the praecipe was mailed or delivered
  
  (i) in the case of a judgment of non pros, after the failure to file a complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe to the party’s attorney of record or to the party if unrepresented, or
  
  (ii) in the case of a judgment by default, after the failure to plead to a complaint and at least ten days prior to the date of the filing of the praecipe to the party against whom judgment is to be entered and to the party’s attorney of record, if any. The ten-day notice period in subdivision (a)(2)(i) and (ii) shall be calculated forward from the date of the mailing or delivery, in accordance with Rule 106.
  
  * Note: The final sentence of Rule 237.1(a)(2) alters the practice described in the decision of Williams v. Wade, 704 A.2d 132 (Pa. Super. 1997).
  
  (3) A copy of the notice shall be attached to the praecipe.
  
  (4) The notice and certification required by this rule may not be waived.
  
  * Note: A certification of notice is a prerequisite in all cases to the entry by praecipe of a judgment of non pros for failure to file a complaint or by default for failure to plead to a complaint. Once the ten-day notice has been given, no further notice is required by the rule even if the time to file the complaint or to plead to the complaint has been extended by agreement. See Rule 237.4 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment of non pros and Rule 237.5 for the form of the notice of intention to enter a judgment by default.
  (b) This rule does not apply to a judgment entered
  
  (1) by an order of court,
  
  (2) upon praecipe pursuant to an order of court, or
  
  (3) pursuant to a rule to show cause.
  
  * Note: See Rule 3284 which requires that in proceedings to fix fair market value of real property sold, notice must be given pursuant to the requirements of Rule 237.1 et seq.
