  Landlord-Tenant Cases
subquestion: |
  The Philadelphia Municipal Court hears cases involving a written or oral lease.  The court has the authority to evict a tenant and to enter money judgment.  However the court cannot hear a case involving a squatter.  To file a landlord tenant case with the Municipal Court, contact (215) 686-2900.

  If you are a tenant/resident appealing a landlord-tenant decision made by the Municipal Court, select “Landlord-tenant appeal from Municipal Court” in the previous menu to review the tools available for landlord-tenant appeals.
