  **Municipal Court**
  
  The Philadelphia Municipal Court handles landlord-tenant cases involving written or oral leases. The court has the authority to decide whether a tenant should be evicted or remain in their home and the authority to enter a money judgment against the landlord or the tenant. However the court cannot hear a case involving a squatter.  

  **Court of Common Pleas**
  
  The Court of Common Pleas has the ability to make decisions about legal and equity actions, appeals from Municipal Court, and appeals from certain administrative agencies and boards. This court has the authority to hear cases involving squatters.
