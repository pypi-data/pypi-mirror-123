  **What’s the difference between an ejectment and landlord/tenant appeal?**
  
  An ejectment is a legal action that can be used by a property owner to remove an occupant from the property when there is no landlord-tenant relationship between the property owner and occupant. Ejectment cases can only be filed in the Court of Common Pleas.
  
  A landlord-tenant appeal is a legal action that can be taken to ask the Court of Common Pleas to review the decision of Municipal Court.
  
  **How to find your case type**

  There are three ways to determine what kind of case you are involved with.
  
    1. Review the documents you received from the court and from the property owner.  You may see the words “ejectment” or “landlord-tenant” on your documents.
    
    2. Search for your case history online in the court dockets.  The case type should be listed at top of the screen for your case. The Court of Common Pleas Civil docket can be found [here.](https://fjdefile.phila.gov/efsfjd/zk_fjd_public_qry_00.zp_disclaimer) and the Municipal Civil Court docket can be found [here.](https://fjdclaims.phila.gov/phmuni/login.do#) [Follow these instructions to search the docket for your case number](${ url_of('docket_instructions.pdf') })
