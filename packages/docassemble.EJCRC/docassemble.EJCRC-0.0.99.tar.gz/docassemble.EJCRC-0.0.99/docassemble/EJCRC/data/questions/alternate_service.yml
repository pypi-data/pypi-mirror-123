  Please review the rule of Pennsylvania of Civil Procedure before completing this document.
subquestion: |
  A Motion for Alternative Service can be filed with the court if the complaint cannot be served to all parties in the case. Please review the following Rules of Pennsylvania Civil Procedure before filing this motion.
  
  ####Rule 430. Service Pursuant to Special Order of Court. Publication.
  
  (a) If service cannot be made under the applicable rule the plaintiff may move the court for a special order directing the method of service. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating the nature and extent of the investigation which has been made to determine the whereabouts of the defendant and the reasons why service cannot be made.
   
  Official Note - A sheriff's return of ''not found'' or the fact that a defendant has moved without leaving a new forwarding address is insufficient evidence of concealment. Gonzales v. Polis, [238 Pa. Super. 362,] 357 A.2d 580 (Pa. Super. 1976). Notice of intended adoption mailed to last known address requires a ''good faith effort'' to discover the correct address. Adoption of Walker, [468 Pa. 165,] 360 A.2d 603 (Pa. 1976).
  
  An illustration of a good faith effort to locate the defendant includes 
  
  (1) inquiries of postal authorities including inquiries pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 39 [CFR] C.F.R. Part 265, 
  
  (2) inquiries of relatives, neighbors, friends, and employers of the defendant, [and] 
  
  (3) examinations of local telephone directories, courthouse records, voter registration records, local tax records, and motor vehicle records, and 
  
  (4) a reasonable internet search.
