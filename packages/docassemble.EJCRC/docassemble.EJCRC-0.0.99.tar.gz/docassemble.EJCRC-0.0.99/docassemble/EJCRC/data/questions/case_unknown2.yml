  **What’s the difference between an ejectment, landlord-tenant case, and a landlord/tenant appeal?**
  
  *Ejectment*
  
  An ejectment is a legal action that can be used by a property owner to remove an occupant from the property when there is no landlord-tenant relationship between the property owner and occupant. Ejectment cases can only be filed in the Court of Common Pleas.

  *Landlord Tenant Case*
  
  The Philadelphia Municipal Court handles landlord-tenant cases involving written or oral leases. The court has the authority to decide whether a tenant should be evicted or remain in their home and the authority to enter a money judgment against the landlord or the tenant. To file a landlord-tenant case contact the Municipal Court at (215) 686-7980.
  
  *Landlord-Tenant Appeal*

  A landlord-tenant appeal is a legal action that can be taken to ask the Court of Common Pleas to change the decision of Municipal Court.
