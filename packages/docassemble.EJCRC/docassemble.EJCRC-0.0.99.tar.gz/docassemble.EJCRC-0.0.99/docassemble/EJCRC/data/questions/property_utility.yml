  Petition to Postpone Sheriff's Sale
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you prepare a petition to postpone your sheriff’s sale.  Please review the Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure on sheriff’s sale postponements below before using this tool.

  **Please review the following rules of Pennsylvania Civil Procedure before completing this form.**

  ###Rule 3129.3. Postponement of Sale. New Notice. Failure of Plaintiff to Attend Sale.
  (a) Except as provided by subdivision (b) or special order of court, new notice shall be given as provided by Rule 3129.2 if a sale of real property is stayed, continued, postponed or adjourned.
  
  (b)(1) If the sale is stayed, continued, postponed or adjourned to a date certain within one hundred thirty days of the scheduled sale, notice of which sale was given as provided by Rule 3129.2, and public announcement thereof, including the new date, is made to the bidders assembled at the time and place fixed for the sale, no new notice as provided by Rule 3129.2 shall be required, but there may be only two such stays, continuances, postponements or adjournments within the one hundred thirty day period without new notice.
  
  (2)(i) When the sale is stayed, continued, postponed or adjourned as provided by subdivision (b)(1), the plaintiff shall file
  
  (A) a notice of the date of continued sheriff's sale with the prothonotary at least fifteen days before the continued sale date, and
  
  (B) a certificate of filing with the sheriff confirming the filing of the notice of the date of continued sheriff's sale with the prothonotary.
  
  The sheriff shall continue the sale to the next available sale date if the notice of the date of continued sheriff's sale has not been timely filed. This continuance imposes a new obligation on the plaintiff to meet the requirements described in (b)(2)(i)(A) and (B).
  
  (ii) Non-compliance with this subdivision is not a basis for setting aside the sheriff's sale unless raised prior to the delivery of the sheriff's deed. The sale shall be set aside only upon a showing of prejudice.
  
  Official Note - This subdivision supersedes other provisions of these rules limiting the number of times a sale may be continued, including the provisions of subdivision (b)(1).
  
  (3)(i) The notice required by subdivision (b)(2) shall be substantially in the following form -

  ###MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PETITION TO POSTPONE SHERIFF’S SALE

  I.	Matter before the Court and Relief Requested
  
  The Petitioner, ${ defendantname1 } (Your Name), pro se, hereby requests that the Court postpone the Sheriff’s Sale of the property located at ${ defendantstreetaddress1 }, Philadelphia, PA, scheduled for ${ sheriffsale } (Date).

  II.	Statement of the Questions Involved
  
  Whether the Court should postpone the Tax Sheriff’s Sale in a tax foreclosure case under the circumstances set forth in the attached Petition.
  
  Suggested Response -- Yes.

  III.	Operative Facts
  
  See attached Petition to Postpone Tax Sheriff’s Sale.
  
  IV.	Legal Argument
  
  The Court may postpone or stay a Sheriff’s Sale in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 3190, which declares that in rem actions to enforce a tax claim are subject to the same rules as a mortgage foreclosures under Pa.R.C.P. 3180 and 3183. Pa.R.C.P. 3183 (b) provides, Execution may be stayed by the court as to all or any part of the property of the defendant upon its own motion or application of any party in interest showing . . . (2) any other legal or equitable ground.

  Pa.R.C.P. 3183 (b)
  
  The power of the Court to stay a Sheriff’s Sale upon a showing of any legal or equitable ground derives not only from the Rules of Court, but also from the inherent power of the court to control its own judgments and thereby prevent injustice. Wilner v. Croyle, 214 Pa. Super. 91, 95, 252 A.2d 387, 389 (1969); Link Building and Loan Association v. Melnick, 325 Pa. 182, 184-185, 189 A. 470, 472 (1937) (Stay of execution is common, citing Sinking Fund Commissioners of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia, 324 Pa. 129, 188 A. 314; Augustine v. Augustine, 291 Pa. 15, 139 A. 585; Lewis v. Linton, 207 Pa. 320, 56 A. 874; Taylor’s Appeal, 93 Pa. 21).
  
  Pennsylvania courts have not shied from applying this power and have granted stays in individual cases, see e.g. GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Pa. v. Watford, No. 2697, No. 23 Clearinghouse Review No. 5 at 619 (Pa. C.P. Phila. Jan. 27, 1988) (Order staying Sheriff’s Sale on foreclosure judgment until defendant’s claim for social security benefits could be resolved), as well as granted mass stays of Sheriff’s Sales. See e.g., In Order Court Staying Sheriff Sale of Owner-Occupied Dwellings, Jan. Term 1983 #3414 (Bradley, C.J., Feb. 1983) (Order Granting Petition to Stay Sheriff’s Sales); In re Order of Court Staying Execution of Sheriff Sales of Debtor Occupied Dwellings, No. 2 1983, Admin. Dkt (C.P. Allegheny Co. 1983) (Papadakos, A.J.); In re Lawrence County Sheriff’s Sales Scheduled for January 18, 1983, No. 9 1983, M.D. (C.P. Lawrence Co. 1983) (Caiazza, J.) (Petition to Stay Sheriff’s Sale due to “the poor state of the local economy” granted).
  
  The power to stay a Sheriff’s Sale is always available to the Court to prevent an inequitable result and a manifest injustice.  Wilner v. Coyle, 214 Pa. Super. at 95, 252 A.2d at 389. The court’s right to stay a Sheriff’s Sale has been equally recognized in Tax Sales. City of Easton v. Lawler, 862 A.2d 170 (2004). In consideration of the inherent uniqueness of real estate, the court found that a party’s “interests may be irrevocably prejudiced by an intervening tax sale.” Id. at 173. The postponement should be granted for the reasons as set forth in the accompanying Petition.
  
  WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court postpone the Sheriff’s Sale of the subject real property as requested in the foregoing Petition.
