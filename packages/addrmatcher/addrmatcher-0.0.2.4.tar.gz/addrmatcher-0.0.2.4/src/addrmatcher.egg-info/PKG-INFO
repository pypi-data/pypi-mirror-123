Addrmatcher is an open-source Python software for matching input string addresses to the most similar street addresses and the geo coordinates inputs to the nearest street addresses. The result provides not only the matched addresses, but also the respective country’s different levels of regions for instance - in Australia, government administrative regions, statistical areas and suburb in which the address belongs to. 

The Addrmatcher library is built to work with rapidfuzz, scipy, pandas, math, ast and provides user-friendly output. It supports python version 3.6 and above. It runs on all popular operating systems, and quick to install and is free of charge. 

In this initial release, the scope of input data and matching capability are limited to Australian addresses only. The Addrmatcher library will see the opportunity to scale the matching beyond Australia in future. 

The development team is thriving to achieve the satisfactory speed of matching. The accuracy of address matching is 80 – 90 percent true positives.
