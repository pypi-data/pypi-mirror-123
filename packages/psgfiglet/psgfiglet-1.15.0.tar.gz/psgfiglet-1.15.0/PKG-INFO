        ## About - What is a Figlet?
        
        A Figlet is a text based way to add large block text to your code or chats.  There are a variety of "Fonts" available that you'll find listed along the left side of the screen.

        ## To use in your code
        
        The easiest way to is make a multiline string in your code using triple quotes:
        
        ```python
        
        '''
        This is a multiline string
        Line 2
        '''
        ```
        
        
        You can simply paste your Figlet into one of these multiline comments.  They work well at breaking up your code into chunks
        
        ```python
        
        '''
                            oo          
                                        
        88d8b.d8b. .d8888b. dP 88d888b. 
        88'`88'`88 88'  `88 88 88'  `88 
        88  88  88 88.  .88 88 88    88 
        dP  dP  dP `88888P8 dP dP    dP
        '''
        
        def main():
            x = 20
        
        ```
