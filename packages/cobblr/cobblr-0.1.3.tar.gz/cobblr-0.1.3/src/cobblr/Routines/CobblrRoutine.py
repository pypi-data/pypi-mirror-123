    Do not use or _super this class.
    It is left here as a template for what needs to go into a routine that can re-run itself.
    Inherited async functions aren't recognised as valid coroutines in:
            asyncio.create_task(coroutine)
            queue.put(coroutine)
    Hence _super'ing this class won't work to create a self re-running task as self.method won't be
    recognised as a valid coroutine.
