        # know
        
        Build live stream tools
        
        To install:	```pip install know```
        
        The tools are made to be able to create live streams of data 
        (e.g. from sensors) and funnel them into proceses with a consistent interfaces. 
        One important process being the process that will store all or part of 
        the data, through a simple storage-system-agnositic facade. 
        
        ```python
        proc = LiveProc(
           source=Sources(  # make a multi-source object (which will manage buffering and timing)
               audio=AudioSource(...),
               plc=PlcSource(...),
               video=VideoSource(...),
           ),
           consumers=Consumers(  # make a multi-data consumer (and/or writer/transformer) object
               storage=Store(...),
               notifications=Notif(...),
               live_viz=LiveViz(...),
           ),
           ...  # other settings for the process (logging, etc.)
        )
        
        proc()  # run the process
        ```
        
        With a variety of sources, target storage systems, etc.
