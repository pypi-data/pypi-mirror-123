  abstract = "Mammalian brain cells are remarkably diverse in gene expression,
              anatomy, and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape
              underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. We
              carried out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse
              brain cell types by applying single nucleus DNA methylation
              sequencing to profile 110,294 nuclei from 45 regions of the mouse
              cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, and olfactory areas. We
              identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and
              projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic
              types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements, and
              transcription factors. These features indicate the potential
              regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell
              types, and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory
              and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA
              methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and
              hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using
              this deep dataset, an artificial neural network model was
              constructed that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type
              identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of
              high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin
              accessibility data allowed prediction of high-confidence
              enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which
              were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin
              conformation capture experiments. By combining multi-omic
              datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open
              chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory
              genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA
              methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal
              diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse brain.
