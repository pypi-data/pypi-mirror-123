# Executable Documentation

## Download `.ipynb` files
The ALLCools documentation is organized by description pages (like the current page) and analysis pages 
(like [this page](../cell_level/basic/mch_mcg_100k_basic.ipynb)). For all the analysis pages, you can download the
executable `.ipynb` using the download button in the top right, and use it as a template for your one data.

## Data files to reproduce this documentation
TODO, I need to find a place for the data I used in writing this documentation.
