                Python is a multi-paradigm, dynamically typed, multipurpose programming language. It is designed to be quick to learn, understand, and use, and enforces a clean and uniform syntax. Please note that Python 2 is officially out of support as of 01-01-2020. Still, for version-specific Python questions, add the [python-2.7] or [python-3.x] tag. When using a Python variant  (e.g., Jython, PyPy) or library (e.g., Pandas and NumPy), please include it in the tags.
            ","Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented (using classes), dynamic and strongly typed programming language that is used for a wide range of applications. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high-level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in c or c++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.
The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, and CGI programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, and parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, and TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you.
Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages, such as C, and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.
Example:
Python program
print(""Hello, Stack Overflow!"")

versus
C program
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printf(""Hello, Stack Overflow!"");
    return 0;
}

Python was originally created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Guido Van Rossum chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).
Python 2 (16 October 2000 - 01 January 2020) has officially been sunset, and Python 3 (3 December 2008) is the only supported, maintained and improved major version as of 01 January 2020. We have a community of people from both worlds, and if you have a question that relates to a specific version, please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using, when asking a question about Python (see Tagging Recommendation section below).
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl.
Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software. It has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks (see Python implementations on the Python wiki).
The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in The Zen of Python, written by Tim Peters, which one can read by issuing this command, in the interactive python interpreter:
>>> import this

Unlike many other languages, Python uses an indentation-based syntax (in which tabs and spaces are noninterchangeable). This may take some getting used to for programmers who are familiar with using braces.
>>> from __future__ import braces
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1
SyntaxError: not a chance
>>>

To help with the transition, using a properly configured text-editor or IDE is recommended. Python comes with a basic IDE called IDLE (python-idle), to get you started. Other popular examples are the charityware Vim, the free GNU Emacs, Eclipse+PyDev, or PyCharm. Take a look at this IDE comparison list for many other alternatives.
There is also a style guide for Python, named PEP 8, which aims to make Python code more readable and consistent. This guide is (should be) followed all across the Python development community.

Tagging Recommendation:
Use the python tag, for all Python-related questions. If you believe your question includes issues specific to individual versions, use python-3.x or python-2.7, in addition to the main python tag. If you believe your question maybe even more specific, you can include a version-specific tag such as python-3.5 or python-3.6, etc.
Also, consider including the tag for the specific implementation (jython, pypy, etc.), if you are using one other than cpython — the use of cpython is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise.
