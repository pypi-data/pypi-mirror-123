Description: This is code to calculate the Cliff's Delta effect size metric, which strangely is not in NumPy/SciPy.stats.
        
        @Timm had [this as a gist](https://gist.github.com/timm/a6e759eb7d9b5f05b468), and @mtorchiano has [R code with tests](https://github.com/mtorchiano/effsize). I have merged them. Well, Marco's code does a lot more. I merged his tests.

        **The Cliff's Delta** statistic is a non-parametric effect size measure that quantifies the amount of difference between two groups of observations beyond p-values interpretation. This measure can be understood as a useful complementary analysis for the corresponding hypothesis testing.
        
        # Installation
        
        This package can either be installed using pip or from a tarball using the standard Python distutils.
        
        If you are installing using ```pip```, you donâ€™t need to download anything as the latest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI:
        
        ```
        pip install cliffs-delta
        ```
        # Example & Usage
        
        Import the method ```cliffs_delta``` from ```cliffs_delta```
        
        ```python
        from cliffs_delta import cliffs_delta
        
        x1 = [10, 20, 20, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50, 100]
        x2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50]
        d, res = cliffs_delta(x1, x2)
        
        print(d,res)
        
        -0.06666666666666667 negligible
        ```
