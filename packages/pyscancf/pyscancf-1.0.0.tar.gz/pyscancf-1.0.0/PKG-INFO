# PyScanCf

Creates PyArt compatible cf-radial data from single scans of IMD Radar data

## Description

PyScanCf is a library for creating cfradial (polar) data containing all 10 sweeps from single scans which are named as (Polar_ABC.nc) as well as gridded radar data from which is named as (grid_ABC.nc). Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite pyart as well.
