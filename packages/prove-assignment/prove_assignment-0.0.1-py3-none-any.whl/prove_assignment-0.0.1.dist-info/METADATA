# AlDa Pipeline

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate development process using the Gitlab CI/CD infrastructure. 1st Assignment for Processo e sviluppo del software course @unimib

## What's has been done so far
We created ```.gtilab-ci.yml``` file where are definded all the stages and jobs listed in the Assignment file.

The project is a simple Python program using ```yfinance``` and ```pandas``` as a requirement. It downloads, using Yahoo Finance APIs, the latest stock prices and volume order of Apple stock. A function able to compute returns (based on adj closes) will be added later.

Regarding the stages developed this is the current status:
