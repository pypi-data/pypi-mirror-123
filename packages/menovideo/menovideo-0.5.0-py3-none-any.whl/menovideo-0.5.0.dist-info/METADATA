# Data-efficient-video-transformer

this repo is for menovideo associated with the paper ['Data Efficient Video Transformer for Violence Detection' (DeVTR)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9530829)
the meno packge   help you build video action recognation model  based on  our Novel model DeVTR 

this is new novel transformer network combined with Conv net to build a highly accuract video action recognation model with limted data and hw rescources 

 In this work, we propose a data-efficient video transformer (DeVTr) based on the transformer network as a Spatio-temporal learning method with a pre-trained 2d-Convolutional neural network (2d-CNN) as an embedding layer for the input data. The model has been trained and tested on the Real-life violence dataset (RLVS) and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%. A comparison of the result for the suggested method with previous techniques illustrated that the suggested method provides the best result among all the other studies for violence event detection.
