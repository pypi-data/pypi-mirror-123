User-visible changes
--------------------

V1.3.0:

- [#34] 'dump' downloads and stores all the inputs and outputs of a job,
        so that all the data is readily available. Replaces 'output', which
        is now deprecated.
- [#33] Print status of job while waiting for completion.


V1.2.0:

- [#32] 'output' downloads the output data assets, not just inline outputs.
- [#31] The 'log' command wouldn't work if the job used 'outputs assets'.
        Fix that.


V1.1.1:

- [#27] Catch timeout errors in the Interactive so that the session is
        not interrupted.


V1.1.0:

- [#3]  Accept 'delete 2-5' to delete a range of jobs.
- [#25] Replace 'inline' command (resp. attribute) in the Interactive
        (resp. library) with 'inputs'.  Deprecate 'inline'.
- [#4]  Introduce 'outputs' command to change the type of
        outputs from inline to data-assets.
- [#21] Read credentials from file $DOWML_CREDENTIALS_FILE
        as last resort.
