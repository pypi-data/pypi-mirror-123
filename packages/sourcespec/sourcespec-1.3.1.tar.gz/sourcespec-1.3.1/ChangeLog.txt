v1.31 - 2021-09-13
	- Fix for HTML report not showing trace and spectral plots
	- HTML report: add Corner Frequency in Event Summary

v1.3 - 2021-08-20
	- HTML reports
	- Option to provide station-specific spectral windowing

v1.2 - 2021-05-20
	- Use python-versioneer to manage version numbers

v1.1 - 2021-04-07
	- Bug fixes:
		- Accept band code "C" for broadband seismometers sampled at >=250 Hz
		- Require cartopy>=0.18 for compatibility with matplotlib>=3.3


v1.0 - 2021-03-03
	- Simplification of time window parameters:
		- an unique window length, "win_length", is used for time-domain S/N ratio
		  calculation and spectral analysis
		- the old parameters, "noise_win_length" and "s_win_length", are no more
		  supported and generate an error
	- Reorganized config file and improved inline documentation within the file
		- removed unused option: fc_0
		- removed "pre_filt" option
		- post-processing check on fc bounds has been removed
	- Option to specify non standard instrument codes (e.g., "L" for
	  acceleration)
	- Option to specify filter frequencies for local magnitude computation
	- Plotting improvements:
		- Show S/N ratio on trace plots
		- Show spectral S/N ratio on spectrum plots
		- Option to show/hide ignored traces/spectra (low S/N)
	- Bug fixes:
		- Pay attention to location code when building average spectra
		- Plotting: avoid overlapping traces with different location code
		- Plotting: avoid overlapping spectra with different location code


v0.9 - 2020-04-24
	- Support for QuakeML input and StationXML
	- Support for Python 3.5
	- Only compatible with ObsPy >= 1.1.0
	- Project reorganization:
		- Project renamed to SourceSpec
		- ssp_residuals renamed to source_residuals
		- New installable package (e.g., via pip)
	- Spectra are smoothed in log-freq (no more Konno-Ohmachi)
	- Inversion is performed in a log-freq space
	- Option to invert for t_star_0 on the plateau level
	- Traces are filtered before computing S/N ratio
	- Trace clipping detection
	- Traces are always plotted, even if no inversion is performed
	- Use by default a global model for theoretical travel time calculation
	- Possibility of using NonLinLoc travel time grids (requires nllgrid)
	- New options for P and S arrival time tolerance
	- New option for maximum epicentral distance for trace processing
	- Possibility of using a NonLinLoc model grid for obtaining vs at the
		source and at the receiver (requires nllgrid)
	- Use log10 of weighting function, since the inversion is done in
		magnitude units
	- Use json format for traceid correction file
	- Save config file to output dir (only for source_spec)
	- Save run completion time into output file
	- Logarithmic average and logarithmic (asymmetric) error bars for Mo, fc
		and source radius
	- Computation of radiated energy
	- Station-specific filters
	- New parameters: gap_max, overlap_max
	- Add legend to spectral plots
	- Add event information, code version and run completion time to plots
	- Multifigure plotting for traces and spectra (for large number of stations)
	- New option to plot a station map, color-coded by station magnitude
		(requires Cartopy)
	- Refactoring of local magnitude computation code:
		- Wood-Anderson amplitude is computed from the whole trace converted
			to W-A and not converting only the min and max peaks (which is
			the default in ObsPy)
		- Trace windowing is computed on HF envelopes
		- New option for custom Ml coefficients
		- Remove unnecessary Ml options
	- Code cleaning and optimization:
		- Switch from optparse (deprecated) to argparse
		- Code style fixes and refactoring
	- New option to update a config file from previous versions
	- BUGFIX: Fix a major bug in reading hypo pick file
	- BUGFIX: Fix for pick file not read in source_model
v0.8 - 2014-07-11
	- Trace plot showing S and noise time windows
	- Improved handling of paz files
	- Per-station Mo on output file
	- Code cleaning and optimization
v0.7 - 2014-04-07
	- Code reorganization:
		- inversion code split to its own functions
	- Option to use bounded inversion
	- Station residuals, through ssp_residuals.py
	- source_model can now output tables of trade-off
		between parameters
	- Fix in the way noise trace is computed and processed
	- Documentation!
v0.6 - 2013-06-05 - Several improvements:
	- Signal to noise weighting
	- Improved local magnitude computation
	- New options:
		- time domain integration
		- vertical component
	- Largely improved plotting function

	- We differentiate between short periods and broad bands
v0.2 - 2012-02-06 - Extended and generalized for the CRL application
v0.1 - 2012-01-17 - Initial Python port
