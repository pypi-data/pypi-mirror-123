        # Warwick iGEM computational modelling
        
        A repository containing code for custom computational modelling components
        within the 2021 Warwick team iGEM project.
        
        ## Model abstract
        
        We propose a validated computational model of the spread of an antibiotic
        resistant pathogens in a hospital, with and without our diagnostic tool for
        quickly identifying it, and show that in a relevant scenario it reduces the
        presence of antibiotic resistant pathogens in our selected scenario, showing our
        product is beneficial in the real-world.
        
        ## Summary
        
        We used Python to implement a discrete time, stochastic, compartmental model of
        the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens through a population.
