# 2. How to use

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetao0806/CloudImage/main/Node_Note_0.11.png)

## 1. Interface Settings
Set the sidebar visible or invisible : `Ctrl+B`

## 2. How to add widgets and use them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetao0806/CloudImage/main/Node_Note_0.12.png)

you can add widgets by the context menu : `Attribute Widget` and  `Logic Widget` and `Draw Widget` 
> `Attribute Widget`: 
- Input and output: Four ports.
- Text input field : Rich text support.
- Expansion and reduction: Press `Shift` and `Lmb` to expand or reduce the attribute widget.

- Embedded unlimited sub widgets.:

|Python highlighter : `Ctrl+6`| Clear alignment: `Ctrl+P` | Bold: `Ctrl+W` |
| ---- |---- | ---- |
| Align left : `Ctrl+[`  |Align right : `Ctrl+]`   | Align center : `Ctrl+ \ ` |
|  Italic : `Ctrl+Q` | Underline : `Ctrl+R`  | Strikethrough: `Ctrl+/` |
| Increase the font: `Ctrl+G` | Decrease the font: `Ctrl+H` | Change the font color: `Ctrl+N` |
| Hyper link: `Ctrl+M` | mathematical formula ($LaTeX$): `Ctrl+I` | Clear format: `Ctrl + L`|
| Undo: `Crtl+Z` | Redo: `Ctrl+Y` | Table: `Ctrl+1` |
| Add a row in a table: `Ctrl+T` | Add a column in a table : `Ctrl+R` | Delete a row in a table : `Ctrl+D` |
| Delete a column in a table : `Ctrl+M` | Add a list : `Ctrl+2` |  Resize the image : `Ctrl+U` |
| Enter the sub scene : `Alt+left_mouse_press` | | |

> `Logic Widget`:
- Input and output: two ports.
- logic controller: two AND-OR-NOT gates.

## 3. Connections and animation.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetao0806/CloudImage/main/Node_Note_0.14.png)

- You can double click the port widget to create pipe widgets. 
- Press `Ctrl 0` at pipe widget or attribute widget to turn on the animation. 
- You can change the pipe position with two controller points.

## 4. The tablet support.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetao0806/CloudImage/main/Node_Note_0.1tablet.gif)
- you can create a draw widget to draw with a tablet.

- The style which contains the width and the color depends on the draw widget style. 

## 5. Other functions.
- collision detection
- Auxiliary line alignment

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetao0806/CloudImage/main/Node_Note_0.1collision_detection.gif)

- The view zoom in and zoom out: `Ctrl + -` å’Œ `Ctrl + +`
- Search everywhere: `Crtl + F`
- Change background image(svg format) and background flowing image(png format): `Resources/Background` and `Resources`
- Save and load: `Ctrl S`(auto sava when close the application) and `Ctrl O` to load `.note` file.

# 3. How to note your knowledge 
For the four ports of the specified `attribute widget`, the left side of the two represents the input, and the two represent the output on the right.
The ports on the top are `TRUE` values and the ports on the bottom are `FALSE` values. 

Why do you have two inputs and two outputs, because for the detailed logic, you have to be certain of your true values of the info,
We have to know whether the ports define the information `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

The logic we're saying is that if you oversleep, and you're going to be late, then if we don't oversleep, it's not necessarily the case, for example, we might have a traffic jam on the road.

We connect the `TRUE` port of `oversplept` node with a `Or` gate of logical controller, and so are others. It is saying that just one of all these `Reasons` is `TRUE`, you can
make the logic circulate.

With the second logic controller,it is saying only all these `Reasons` are `FALSE`, the `late` can be `FALSE`

Also, We can use tablet to help us note sth that text/logic can not express.
