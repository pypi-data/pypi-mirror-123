        For the instance regularization_matrix scheme, there is only 1 regularization coefficient that is applied to \
        all neighboring pixels. This means that we when write B, we only need to regularize pixels in one direction \
        (e.g. pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, but NOT visa versa). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [0, -1]  1 does not regularization with 0

        A small numerical value of 1.0e-8 is added to all elements in a instance regularization matrix, to ensure that \
        it is positive definite.
