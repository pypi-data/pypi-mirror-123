def data_slim_to_pixelization_unique_from(
    data_pixels, pixelization_index_for_sub_slim_index: np.ndarray, sub_size: int
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Create an array describing the unique mappings between the sub-pixels of every slim data pixel and the pixelization
    pixels, which is used to perform efficiently linear algebra calculations.

    For example, assuming `sub_size=2`:

    - If 3 sub-pixels in image pixel 0 map to pixelization pixel 2 then `data_pix_to_unique[0, 0] = 2`.
    - If the fourth sub-pixel maps to pixelizaiton pixel 4, then `data_to_pix_unique[0, 1] = 4`.

    The size of the second index depends on the number of unique sub-pixel to pixelization pixels mappings in a given
    data pixel. In the example above, there were only two unique sets of mapping, but for high levels of sub-gridding
    there could be many more unique mappings all of which must be stored.

    The array `data_to_pix_unique` does not describe how many sub-pixels uniquely map to each pixelization pixel for
    a given data pixel. This information is contained in the array `data_weights`. For the example above,
    where `sub_size=2` and therefore `sub_fraction=0.25`:

    - `data_weights[0, 0] = 0.75` (because 3 sub-pixels mapped to this pixelization pixel).
    - `data_weights[0, 1] = 0.25` (because 1 sub-pixel mapped to this pixelization pixel).

    The `sub_fractions` are stored as opposed to the number of sub-pixels, because these values are used directly
    when performing the linear algebra calculation.

    The array `pix_lengths` in a 1D array of dimensions [data_pixels] describing how many unique pixelization pixels
    each data pixel's set of sub-pixels maps too.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_pixels
        The total number of data pixels in the dataset.
    pixelization_index_for_sub_slim_index
        The mappings between the pixelization grid's pixels and the data's slimmed pixels.
    sub_size
        The size of the sub-grid defining the number of sub-pixels in every data pixel.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The unique mappings between the sub-pixels of every data pixel and the pixelization pixels, alongside arrays
        that give the weights and total number of mappings.

    Returns the mappings between a set of slimmed sub-grid pixels and pixelization pixels, using information on

    and the pixelization's pixel centres.

    To determine the complete set of slim sub-pixel to pixelization pixel mappings, we must pair every sub-pixel to
    its nearest pixel. Using a full nearest neighbor search to do this is slow, thus the pixel neighbors (derived via
    the Voronoi grid) are used to localize each nearest neighbor search by using a graph search.

    """
    Returns the (hyper) signal in each pixel, where the signal is the sum of its mapped data values.
    These pixel-signals are used to compute the effective regularization weight of each pixel.

    The pixel signals are computed as follows:

    1) Divide by the number of mappe data points in the pixel, to ensure all pixels have the same
    'relative' signal (i.e. a pixel with 10 pixels doesn't have x2 the signal of one with 5).

    2) Divided by the maximum pixel-signal, so that all signals vary between 0 and 1. This ensures that the
    regularization weight_list are defined identically for any data quantity or signal-to-noise_map ratio.

    3) Raised to the power of the hyper-parameter *signal_scale*, so the method can control the relative
    contribution regularization in different regions of pixelization.

    Parameters
    -----------
    pixels
        The total number of pixels in the pixelization the regularization scheme is applied to.
    signal_scale
        A factor which controls how rapidly the smoothness of regularization varies from high signal regions to
        low signal regions.
    regular_to_pix
        A 1D array util every pixel on the grid to a pixel on the pixelization.

        The image of the galaxy which is used to compute the weigghted pixel signals.
