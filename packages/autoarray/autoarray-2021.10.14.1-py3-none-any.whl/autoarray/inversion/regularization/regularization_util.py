    pixel_neighbors
        An array of length (total_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the Voronoi grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    pixel_neighbors_sizes
        An array of length (total_pixels) which gives the number of neighbors of every pixel in the
        Voronoi grid.

    Returns the regularization weight_list (the effective regularization coefficient of every pixel). They are computed
    using the pixel-signal of each pixel.

    Two regularization coefficients are used, corresponding to the:

    1) (pixel_signals) - pixels with a high pixel-signal (i.e. where the signal is located in the pixelization).
    2) (1.0 - pixel_signals) - pixels with a low pixel-signal (i.e. where the signal is not located in the
     pixelization).

    Parameters
    ----------
    coefficients
        The regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction.
    pixel_signals
        The estimated signal in every pixelization pixel, used to change the regularization weighting of high signal
        and low signal pixelizations.

        The regularization_ weight of each pixel, which governs how much smoothing is applied to that individual pixel.
