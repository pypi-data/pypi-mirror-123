        # Investing Algorithm Framework
        The Investing Algorithm Framework is a python framework for building
        investment algorithms. 
        It encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic code design.
        
        
        ```python
        import os
        
        from investing_algorithm_framework import App, TimeUnit, AlgorithmContext, \
            BinanceOrderExecutor, BinancePortfolioManager
        
        # Make the parent dir your resources directory (database, csv storage)
        dir_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.realpath(__file__), os.pardir))
        
        # Create an algorithm application (manages your algorithm, rest api, etc...)
        app = App(resources_directory=dir_path)
        
        
        # Create A portfolio manager connected to your market of
        # choice to keep track of your balances
        class MyBinancePortfolioManager(BinancePortfolioManager):
            trading_symbol = "USDT"
            api_key = "xxxxx"
            secret_key = "xxxxx"
        
        
        # Worker that runs every minute to check your pending orders
        # (success, failed, canceled)
        @app.algorithm.schedule(time_unit=TimeUnit.MINUTE, interval=1)
        def check_order_status(context: AlgorithmContext):
            context.check_pending_orders()
        
        
        # Algorithm strategy that runs every 5 minutes
        @app.algorithm.schedule(time_unit=TimeUnit.MINUTE, interval=5)
        def perform_strategy(context: AlgorithmContext):
            # Apply strategy ....
        
            # Execute order
            context.create_market_buy_order(
                "BINANCE", "BTC", amount=10, execute=True
            )
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Register your market portfolio manager
            app.algorithm.add_portfolio_manager(MyBinancePortfolioManager())
        
            # Register your market order executor
            app.algorithm.add_order_executor(BinanceOrderExecutor())
            
            # Start your investing algorithm
            app.start()
        
        ```

        In most cases, you'll probably never have to change code on this repo directly 
        if you are building your algorithm/bot. But if you do, check out the 
        contributing page at the website.

        #### Disclaimer
        If you use this framework for your investments, do not risk money 
        which you are afraid to lose, until you have clear understanding how

        THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR INVESTMENT RESULTS.
        
        Also, make sure that you read the source code of any plugin you use or 
        implementation of an algorithm made with this framework.

        Feel like the framework is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests!
        
        Please read our [Contributing document](https://github.com/investing-algorithms/investing-algorithm-framework/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        to understand the requirements before sending your pull-requests.
        
        **Note** before starting any major new feature work, *please open an issue describing what you are planning to do* or talk to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/investingbots/shared_invite/enQtODgwNTg3MzA2MjYyLTdiZjczZDRlNWJjNDdmYThiMGE0MzFhOTg4Y2E0NzQ2OTgxYjA1NzU3ZWJiY2JhOTE1ZGJlZGFiNDU3OTAzMDg).
        This will ensure that interested parties can give valuable feedback on the feature, and let others know that you are working on it.
        
        **Important:** Always create your feature or hotfix against the `develop` branch, not `master`.
