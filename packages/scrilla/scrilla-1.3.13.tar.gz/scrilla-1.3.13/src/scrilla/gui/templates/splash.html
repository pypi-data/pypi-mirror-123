<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
    <i>scrilla</i> is a financial analysis application. It can calculate a variety of statistics and generate graphical summaries of historical data. Tabular summaries can be saved to your local file system in <i>json</i> or <i>csv</i> format, while graphical summaries can be saved in <i>jpeg</i> format.
</p>

<p>
    Data is retrieved from several external sources, such as <strong>AlphaVantage</strong>, <strong>Quandl</strong> and <strong>IEX</strong>. You will need to register for API keys and give them to <i>scrilla</i> before it will be able to pull data and perform calculations. 
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
    Register for API keys using the following links

    <ul>
        <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key">AlphaVantage</a></li>
        <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://www.quandl.com/account/api">Quandl</a></li>
        <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://iexcloud.io/">IEX</a></li>
    </ul>

    Once you have your keys, add them to <i>scrilla</i> through the menu bar option <strong>Account > Add API Key</strong>. Keep in mind, if you are using the free tier keys, the API rate limits can affect the speed of the application.
