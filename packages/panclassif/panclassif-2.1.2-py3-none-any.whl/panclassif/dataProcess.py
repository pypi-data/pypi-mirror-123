	'''
	Parameters
	----------
	`homepath` (str): 
	  Path where you want to save all the generated files 
	  and folders. 
	`cancerpath` (str): 
	  Path where all the cancer's cancer gene expression
	  matrix are located.
	`names` (list): 
	  List of the cancer names found from `featSelect`
	  function.
	`smoothed_cancer` (str): 
	  Path where all the cancer's smoothed cancer gene expression
	  matrix are located.
	`smoothed_normal` (str): 
	  Path where all the cancer's smoothed normal gene expression
	  matrix are located.
	`scale_mode` (int):
	  Here (0 is for Standardization and 1 for normalization) for data scalling

	Return:
	-------
	None

	Outputs:
	--------
	Split the treated data into train and test. train datas
	are saved in "/pre_upsample_train_data" and test datas
	are save in "/test_data". Unique genes name are saved
	in "/std_npy" folder as "unique_genes_with_frequency.csv" 
	with their respective frequency.
