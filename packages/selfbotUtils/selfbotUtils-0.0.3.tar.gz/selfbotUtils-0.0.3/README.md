Information
-----------
What is a phoneban?

A phoneban is basically when discord blocks your account, and makes it not accessable until you verify your email and add a phone number to the account.

selfbotUtils bypasses the discord phoneban detection system by sending custom headers, payloads, etc.

Examples
--------------

Examples are listed in the examples folder.

Known Issues
--------------

- None.

Disclaimer
----------

Automating user accounts is against the Discord ToS. This library is a proof of concept. Use at your own risk.
