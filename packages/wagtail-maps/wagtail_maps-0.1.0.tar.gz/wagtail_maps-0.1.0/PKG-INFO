Description: # wagtail-maps
        
        Create and display maps with points in Wagtail.
        
        **Warning!** This project is still early on in its development lifecycle. It is
        possible for breaking changes to occur between versions until reaching a stable
        1.0. Feedback and pull requests are welcome.
        
        This package extend Wagtail to add a new Map model, which is composed by one or
        more points. Each point may have a title, some content and link to an internal
        or external URL. Once you have configured your map from the Wagtail admin, you
        will be able to display it in a page - e.g. as a StreamField block.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        This package requires the following:
        - **Wagtail >= 2.14**: upstream patches have been submitted to provide a proper
          integration of this extension into the admin - see [#7562], [#7565] and
          [#7590]
        - **Django** (3.1, 3.2)
        - **Python 3** (3.7, 3.8, 3.9)
        
        [#7562]: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7562
        [#7565]: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7565
        [#7590]: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7590
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Install using ``pip``:
           ```shell
           pip install wagtail-maps
           ```
        2. Add ``wagtail_maps`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:
           ```python
           INSTALLED_APPS = [
               # ...
               'wagtail_maps',
               # ...
           ]
           ```
        3. Include the URL of *wagtail-maps* to your ``urls.py`` file:
           ```python
           from wagtail_maps import urls as wagtailmaps_urls
        
           urlpatterns = [
               # ...
               path('maps/', include(wagtailmaps_urls)),
               # ...
           ]
           ```
        4. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the models
        
        ## Usage
        
        A StreamField block `wagtail_maps.blocks.MapBlock` can be used to display a
        map - choosen from the current ones - in your page. The JavaScript code and the
        Leaflet package is currently not shipped, but you can find an example in
        [examples/frontend/](examples/frontend/).
        
        ## Development
        ### Quick start
        
        To set up a development environment, ensure that Python 3 is installed on your
        system. Then:
        
        1. Clone this repository
        2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
           ```shell
           python3 -m venv venv
           source venv/bin/activate
           ```
        3. Install this package in develop mode with extra requirements:
           ```shell
           pip install -e .[test]
           ```
        
        ### Contributing
        
        The Python code is formatted and linted thanks to [flake8], [isort] and [black].
        To ease the use of this tools, the following commands are available:
        - `make lint`: check the Python code syntax and imports order
        - `make format`: fix the Python code syntax and imports order
        
        The tests are written with [pytest] and code coverage is measured with [coverage].
        You can use the following commands for that:
        - ``make test``: run the tests and output a quick report of code coverage
        - ``make coverage``: run the tests and produce an HTML report of code coverage
        
        When submitting a pull-request, please ensure that the code is well formatted
        and covered, and that all the other tests pass.
